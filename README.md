## Overview

The maicplus package provides tools to perform matching-adjusted indirect
comparison (MAIC) analysis. MAIC is a method used to adjust for differences
in baseline characteristics between treatment groups in indirect comparisons,
typically where patient-level data are available for one treatment but only
aggregate-level data are available for the comparator treatment.

## Features

- Perform MAIC analysis for time-to-event endpoints (e.g. overall survival) or binary endpoints (e.g. objective tumor response).

- Perform unanchored analysis when comparing single-arm trials or anchored analysis when there exists a common comparator between trials.

- User-friendly functions to facilitate the analysis process.

- Comprehensive documentation and examples to guide users through the analysis.
