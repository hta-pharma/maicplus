\title{Forest Plot for One or More MAIC Objects}
\usage{
maic_forest_plot(..., xlim = c(0, 1.5), reference_line = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more MAIC objects. Each object must contain an \code{inferential$summary} data frame
with the columns \code{"HR"}, \code{"OR"}, or \code{"RR"} (one of these must be present), along with \code{"LCL"},
\code{"UCL"}, \code{"pval"}, and a \code{case} identifier column.}

\item{xlim}{A numeric vector of length two, specifying the limits of the effect-size axis
in the resulting forest plot. Defaults to \code{c(0, 1.5)}.}

\item{reference_line}{A numeric value specifying where to draw the "no-effect" reference line
on the forest plot. Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A \link[patchwork:patchwork-package]{patchwork} object that combines:
\itemize{
\item A forest plot of the provided effect estimates and their 95\\% confidence intervals.
\item A corresponding table listing each estimate in numeric form, along with the p-value.
}
Printing or plotting this returned object will display both the forest plot and the summary table.
}
\description{
This function compiles effect estimates (and their confidence intervals) from one or more
"MAIC objects" – typically the output from \code{\link[=maic_anchored]{maic_anchored()}} or \code{\link[=maic_unanchored]{maic_unanchored()}} functions –
and creates a forest plot alongside a summary table of those effect estimates.
}
\details{
This function extracts the effect estimates (e.g., HR, OR, or RR) and their confidence intervals
from each provided MAIC object. It then stacks all estimates into a single data frame for plotting.
A forest plot is generated using \strong{ggplot2} with vertical error bars displaying the confidence intervals.
The \code{reference_line} is drawn as a dashed line to indicate the null value (usually 1, meaning no difference).

Below the forest plot, a table is constructed showing the point estimate and 95\% confidence interval
for each row, along with its p-value. If the p-value is less than 0.001, it is displayed as \code{"< 0.001"},
otherwise it is displayed to three decimal places.
