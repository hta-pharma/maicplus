\arguments{
\item{weights_object}{an object returned by \code{estimate_weight}}

\item{ipd}{a data frame that meet format requirements in 'Details', individual patient data (IPD) of internal trial}

\item{pseudo_ipd}{a data frame, pseudo IPD from digitized KM curve of external trial (for time-to-event endpoint) or from contingency table (for binary endpoint)}

\item{trt_ipd}{a string, name of the interested investigation arm in internal trial \code{dat_igd} (real IPD)}

\item{trt_agd}{a string, name of the interested investigation arm in external trial \code{pseudo_ipd} (pseudo IPD)}

\item{trt_var_ipd}{a string, column name in \code{ipd} that contains the treatment assignment}

\item{trt_var_agd}{a string, column name in \code{ipd} that contains the treatment assignment}

\item{endpoint_type}{a string, one out of the following "binary", "tte" (time to event), "continuous"}

\item{endpoint_name}{a string, name of time to event endpoint, to be show in the last line of title}

\item{eff_measure}{a string, "Diff" for continuous,"RD" (risk difference), "OR" (odds ratio), "RR" (relative risk) for a binary endpoint; "HR" for a time-to-event endpoint. By default is \code{NULL}, "OR" is used for binary case, otherwise "HR" is used.}

\item{time_scale}{a string, time unit of median survival time, taking a value of 'years', 'months', 'weeks' or 'days'. NOTE: it is assumed that values in TIME column of \code{ipd} and \code{pseudo_ipd} is in the unit of days}

\item{km_conf_type}{a string, pass to \code{conf.type} of \code{survfit}}
}
\value{
A list, contains 'descriptive' and 'inferential'
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function to provide adjusted effect estimates and relevant statistics in unanchored case
(i.e. there is no common comparator arm in the internal and external trial).
}
\details{
For time-to-event analysis, it is required that input \code{ipd} and \code{pseudo_ipd} to have the following columns. This function is not sensitive to upper or lower case of letters in column names.
\itemize{
\item USUBJID - character, unique subject ID
\item ARM - character or factor, treatment indicator, column name does not have to be 'ARM'. User specify in \code{trt_var_ipd} and \code{trt_var_agd}
\item EVENT - numeric, 1 for censored/death, 0 for otherwise
\item TIME - numeric column, observation time of the \code{EVENT}; unit in days
}
}
