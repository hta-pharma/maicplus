}
\arguments{
\item{ipd_weights}{an object returned by \code{estimate_weight}}

\item{tte_dat_ipd}{a data frame of individual patient data (IPD) of internal trial, contain at least "USUBJID", "EVENT", "TIME" columns and a column indicating treatment assignment}

\item{ipd_trt_var}{a string, column name in \code{dat_ipd} that contains the treatment assignment}

\item{tte_dat_pseudo}{a data frame of pseudo IPD by digitized KM curves of external trial (for time-to-event endpoint), contain at least "EVENT", "TIME"}

\item{pseudo_trt_var}{a string, column name in \code{dat_ipd} that contains the treatment assignment}

\item{endpoint_name}{a string, name of time to event endpoint, to be show in the last line of title}

\item{trt_ipd}{a string, name of the interested investigation arm in internal trial \code{dat_igd} (real IPD)}

\item{trt_agd}{a string, name of the interested investigation arm in external trial \code{dat_pseudo} (pseudo IPD)}

\item{trt_common}{a string, name of the common comparator in internal and external trial, by default is NULL, indicating unanchored case}

\item{time_scale}{a string, time unit of median survival time, taking a value of 'years', 'months', 'weeks' or 'days'}

\item{zph_transform}{a string, pass to \code{survival::cox.zph}, default is "log"}

\item{zph_log_hazard}{a logical, if TRUE (default), y axis of the time dependent hazard function is log-hazard, otherwise, hazard.}
}
\value{
