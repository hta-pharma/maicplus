#' Calculate MAIC weights that maximize effective sample size (ESS)
#'
#' This function computes MAIC weights by solving a constrained optimization
#' problem to maximize the effective sample size (ESS) while achieving exact
#' balance on baseline covariates. This methodology is an alternative to
#' conventional MAIC and is based on the work of Zubizarreta (2015), as
#' discussed in Jackson et al. (2020).
#'
#' @param covariates A data frame or matrix of individual-level baseline
#'   covariates from the trial of interest. Column names must match the
#'   names in `target_means`.
#' @param target_means A named numeric vector or list of the mean values of the
#'   same covariates in the target comparator population.
#'
#' @return A list containing:
#'   - `weights`: A numeric vector of the calculated MAIC weights.
#'   - `ess`: The effective sample size of the weighted population.

  # Step 2: Set up the optimization problem for `limSolve::lsei`.
  # The objective is to minimize the sum of squared weights, min(||w*||^2).
  # We set the `A` matrix to the identity matrix and `B` vector to zeros.
  A <- diag(n)
  B <- rep(0, n)

  # The constraints are:
  # 1. Sum of weights equals 1
  # 2. Weighted mean of centered covariates equals zero
  # This corresponds to the `E` matrix and `F` vector arguments.

  # This corresponds to the `G` matrix and `H` vector.

  # Step 5: Calculate the effective sample size (ESS)
  # The paper's formula is (sum of weights)^2 / (sum of weights^2).
  # Since we constrained the weights to sum to 1, this simplifies to 1 / sum(weights^2).
